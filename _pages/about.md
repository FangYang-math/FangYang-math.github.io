Now I am a postdoc at [MPIM Bonn](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/de), after I obtained my doctorate degree at Tsinghua University in the fall of 2024, under the supervision of Professor Fan Xu. I work in the field of algebraic representation theory.

My reserach interests are cluster algebras and Hall algebras. In particular, I am very interested in the categorification of quantum cluster algebras and Cohomological Hall algebras.
